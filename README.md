-Question 2.3: 1-2 min
-Question 3.1: 5-6 min
-Question 3.1: 1-2 min

# Get the outputs:
-For question 2.1, Requested feature_set.csv will be created in the same directory as the source code.
-For question 2.2, Requested test_accuracy.csv will be created in the same directory as the source code. Also the output will be diplayed in the terminal.
-For question 2.3, Requested test_accuracy_laplace.csv will be created in the same directory as the source code. Also the output will be diplayed in the terminal.
-For question 3.1, Requested forward_selection.csv will be created in the same directory as the source code. Also the output will be diplayed in the terminal.
